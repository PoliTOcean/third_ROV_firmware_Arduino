/*********************************************************************
  This is an example for scanning the I2C bus 7-bit address range
  and reporting all addresses that have functioning devices
  attached.
  Based on several I2C scanner programs found at:
  https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner
  Addresses scanned:  0x08 to 0x77
  Reserved address ranges NOT scanned: 0000xxx and 1111xxx
  For more information about I2C specifications, refer to:
  https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10204.pdf
  For a list of many known I2C device addresses:

  This code is released to the public domain.
